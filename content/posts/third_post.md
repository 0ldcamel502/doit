### Criminal behavior

In light of criminal behavior becoming not only a new norm in Russia but a lucrative occupation, The Russian Ministry of Justice has added the civil network movement “Peace. Progress. Human Rights” to the list of extremist organizations.

### Russian authority

Russian authorities have criminalized search queries on the internet. The full list of tens of thousands of terms and materials designated as extremist has been prepared but undisclosed by the presidential administration.

### Yandex search

As a result Yandex search queries have been declining for the second month in a row. Russian internet users are afraid to ask national search engine any questions. If you don’t ask questions, you don’t get answers. And it’s better that way for the repressive state. And yet enforced ignorance results in enforced bliss everyone wants to run away from.

AI is also under attack as it allegedly does not represent “traditional values.” Russian authorities are looking for ways to censor it, too. Having proclaimed Satanism as an extremist organization, the focus of parliament has shifted to adding “liberalism” to the same list.
