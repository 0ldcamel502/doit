Several days ago, Bazanov - the man, not the actor - was arrested on charges of murder he allegedly committed in 2011. He brutally k#%^ed a businessman who was refusing to pay extortion fees, and also committed a robbery.

Bazanov didnâ€™t try to deny the charges and went straight to the combat zone right from the detention center. If he survives the next six months, Putin will pardon Bazanov. This freshly baked Hero of Russia will then be able to sell the rights to a movie or TV show based on the real crimes he committed and be the main star in it.
