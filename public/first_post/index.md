What were the main obstacles that prevented a true free market economy from developing in Russia during the 1990s?

The most popular TV mini series in Russia in the last two years is “The Word of the Boy.” Set in the criminal 1990s, it is about youth gangs glorifying their code of honor and random violence.

Actor Sergei Bazanov (in singlet) played Demida, a dangerous member of Universam criminal gang. Fans of the show agreed whole-heartedly that Bazanov had really transformed into his character and must have gone through brutal mental preparation to play such a mean gangster so realistically.
